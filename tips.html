    <h3> Lets start with some basic tips: </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> REUSE!! </li>
          <ul>
          <li> Keep Cups! Say goodbye to single-use plastic coffee cups; keep-cups offer a great way to grab coffee on the go! Most places offer a discount for them too. Check out that 50p filter from Pret! </li>
          <li> Resuable Water Bottles! We're constantly being told to drink more water, and what better way to stay hydrated than carrying your own water bottle, which saves money too! No need to continually by single-use bottles! </li>
          <li> Bring your own bag! Don't go to the supermarket unarmed! No need to spend the extra 5p on a bag, just keep a bag in your handbag/backpack so when you buy <i>all</i> the food, you've got something to carry it in! </li>
          </ul>
      <br>
      <li> FOOD!! </li>
        <ul>
        <li> Try "Meatfree Mondays"! An easy way to experiment with veggie food, and slowly saving money and lowering your carbon footprint! </li>
        <li> Compost! Grab some compostable bags and start putting foodscraps in there, rather than the normal bin! </li>
        <li> Try and buy from bulk shops. Think about where your food is coming from. How many airmiles? How much plastic is in its wrapping? Check our page for more eco-friendly shopping in Edinburgh! </li>
        <li> Tubawear Lunches! Go single-use, plastic-free at lunchtime by bringing your food from home! Save your money and the packaging by skipping the meal deal! </li>
        <li> Infact, tubawear in general is a great way to prevent food waste! Make soups and stews that can be easily frozen, to make sure no food goes bad! Chop vegetables and freeze them! Use tubawear rather than single-use freezelock bags!! </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      <li> SPEND LESS! </li>
            <ul>
              <li> Borrow clothes! Need a dress for <i> one </i> occassion? Find a friend and borrow, save the money and try to give less to the problematic fashion industry! </li>
              <li> In fact, hit the charity shops, such as Ebay and other second hand options. Don't let clothes go to waste, think about creating a cycle with your purchases! (hit the charity shop again when you no longer want it!) </li>
              <li> Buy less stuff, do you <i>really</i> need that knick-knack? that new teeshirt you'll never wear? </li>
              <li> Holidays! Now, we all love a good Christmas cracker, but how many people remember that bad joke? Or treasure the little gift? Think about making your own, get festive with arts and crafts! Think about wrapping paper; why not give an 'experience day', rather than something they might not like! Or maybe wrapping in newspaper? </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
<br>
  <p> Just have fun!! These are just a few tips to help you get started! Don't feel guilty if you buy apples with plastic on them (it's the supermarkets who really need to do a better job!!), just do your best, every little helps! </p>
